  // input color and the returned luminance may not reach the contrast ratio
  // asked for.
  //
  // When the desired contrast ratio and the result contrast ratio differ
  // by more than this amount, an error value should be returned, or the method

  // To be displayed, they must gamut map to a "display space", one that has
  // a defined limit on the number of colors. Display spaces include sRGB,
  // more commonly understood  as RGB/HSL/HSV/HSB.
  // Gamut mapping is undefined and not defined by the color space. Any gamut
  // mapping algorithm must choose how to sacrifice accuracy in hue, saturation,
  // and/or lightness.
  //
  // A principled solution is to maintain lightness, thus maintaining
  // contrast/a11y, maintain hue, thus maintaining aesthetic intent, and reduce
  // chroma until the color is in gamut.
  //
  // HCT chooses this solution, but, that doesn't mean it will _exactly_ matched
  // desired lightness, if only because RGB is quantized: RGB is expressed as
  // a set of integers: there may be an RGB color with, for example,
  // 47.892 lightness, but not 47.891.
  //
  // To allow for this inherent incompatibility between perceptually accurate
  // color spaces and display color spaces, methods that take a contrast ratio
  // and luminance, and return a luminance that reaches that contrast ratio for
  // the input luminance, purposefully darken/lighten their result such that
  // the desired contrast ratio will be reached even if inaccuracy is introduced.
  //
  // 0.4 is generous, ex. HCT requires much less delta. It was chosen because it
  // provides a rough guarantee that as long as a perceptual color space gamut
  // maps lightness such that the resulting lightness rounds to the same
  //  as the requested, the desired contrast ratio will be reached.
